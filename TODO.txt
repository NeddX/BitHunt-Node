- Front:
	- Brend:
		- Implement multi-canvas system
		- Implement canvas child system
		- Overall opitimization

- Back:
	- Game:
		- Implement an engine framework
		- The engine framework must have a renderer class that the game will call
		- Renderer class must batch render on each frame
		- Rewrite bithunt using this new framework
		- An object pool would be cool
	- Server:
		- Make the server wait for the frontend to finish rendering before updating to prevent flickering
