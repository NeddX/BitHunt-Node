# Game of Life
Assignment project.

# Gameplay
- Customize your simulation using the handy editor tool I made.
- Interact with the game by selecting an element and click on the game canvas. Note that There's a cooldown between each interaction!

# Dependencies
Download all of the necessary dependencies inorder for this to work!
- `express`
- `socket.io`
- `zlib`

# Run
The main file is `server.js` so run it by typing `node server.js` into your shell.
The server listens on the port 80 so you can just type `localhost` in your browser and connect to it.
